    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This camp breakfast idea is a good way to start a cold day in the morning, camping or otherwise. My mother used to make this warm, hearty recipe when we were camping. Serve in a bowl with toast and coffee for a satisfying breakfast.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>6 slices bacon, cut crosswise into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>2 white potatoes, cubed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir bacon in a large skillet over medium heat until crispy, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, discarding most of the grease.</li>
        <li>Add olive oil to the same skillet over medium heat. Add potatoes, salt, and pepper; cook and stir until browned and somewhat crispy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix onion into potatoes and cook until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Return bacon to the skillet; cook and stir until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour beaten eggs over potato mixture; cook and stir until eggs are set, 5 to 6 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
